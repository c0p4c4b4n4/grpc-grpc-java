Critical Updates for 2025-2026 (Online Resources)
Because Go 1.24 (released Feb 2025) introduced the Swiss Table map implementation, most physical books will not have this yet.
For "Map" internals (Swiss Tables): Refer to the Official Go Blog on Swiss Tables and recent Go 1.24 Release Notes.
For "Project Layout": The Golang Standards Project Layout remains the community-accepted skeleton for 2026.
For "Runtime" debugging: The Official Go GC Guide is the best source for GOMEMLIMIT and GOGC tuning.
